# ML---Project


# The goal of the project is to create econometric and machine learning models that
# correctly predict individuals with income levels greater than $50,000 from the 1994 US census dataset published at the University of California Irvine. The data contained factors like age, occupation, and investment returns that will be further explained in the data summary portion. At the start of the project we suspect that variables like age, sex, and occupation will all be major factors in determining income level.
